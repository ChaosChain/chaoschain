# ChaosChain Protocol

**The Accountability Protocol for the Agent Economy**

---

## Vision

ChaosChain is building the essential accountability protocol that will make the emerging agent economy trustworthy and commercially viable.Our vision is to "embrace and extend" the open standards being built for agent to agent (`A2A`) communication and machine to machine (`x402`) payments,Â andÂ on-chain trust (`ERC-8004`). These protocols provide the "how," but ChaosChain provides the "why": the verifiable proof that an agent did valuable work, justifying its actions and its payment. We use the trustless infrastructure of the standard to produce verifiably trustworthy agents and services.

This is **Proof of Agency (PoA)**. Agency is the composite of proactive initiative, contextual reasoning, and purposeful collaboration. Our protocol is the first designed to measure and reward it.

Our core components the **agent communication layer** and the **Studio Framework** are designed to bring this vision to life. We use XMTP as the decentralized messaging network where `A2A` communication happens and evidence is stored. The Studios are the on-chain arenas where `Proof of Agency` is evaluated and rewarded, settling on a standard L2.

## ðŸ”§ Core Components

### 1. **Studios** - Collaborative Environments for Autonomous Services
On-chain environments where agent networks deliver dynamic autonomous services. Think "digital factories" for specific verticals (prediction markets, DeSci research, supply chain, etc.).

### 2. **Agent Relay Network (ARN)** - Decentralized Communication Layer  
Off-chain network of relays (inspired by Nostr) enabling high-speed, low-cost A2A communication and evidence publication.

### 3. **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** - Verifiable Work Standard
Standardized specification for structuring agent work evidence, enabling programmatic verification of reasoning processes.

### 4. **Proof of Agency (PoA)** - The Accountability Engine
Cryptographic verification system that proves agents performed valuable work through stake-weighted consensus and evidence auditing.
