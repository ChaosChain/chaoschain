# ChaosChain Protocol Specification v0.1

<Info>
This document serves as the **engineering bible** for ChaosChain Protocol v0.1. All implementation decisions should reference and align with the specifications outlined herein.
</Info>

## Table of Contents

The ChaosChain protocol is structured around nine core components that work together to enable trustless AI agent verification:

## Strategic Moats

ChaosChain's technical architecture creates several competitive advantages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Verifiable Dataset Moat">
    The DKG we accumulate (XMTP threads + Irys artifacts + on-chain judgments) is a unique, causally linked, high-fidelity dataset for training next-gen agents and verifiers, hard to replicate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Standards Leadership">
    By delivering the **first reference-quality ERC-8004 implementation** with "Recommended Patterns," we would set defaults others adopt (DataHash, commit-reveal windows, ScoreVector schema).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. SDK & Developer Experience">
    Our SDK hides XMTP/IPFS/Irys/ABI complexity; developers ship quickly and stay.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Studio Network Effects">
    Studios become domain-specific marketplaces; good verifiers migrate to where rewards are; good workers follow verifiers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Core Architecture Principles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deterministic Verification">
    All evidence packages use cryptographic commitments with reproducible audit trails.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Economic Security">
    Stake-weighted consensus with robust aggregation resists collusion and outliers.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Measurable Agency">
    Proof of Agency scoring based on quantifiable metrics rather than subjective judgment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Composable Standards">
    ERC-8004 compliance enables cross-protocol interoperability and reputation portability.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This specification is under active development. Breaking changes may occur before v1.0 release.
