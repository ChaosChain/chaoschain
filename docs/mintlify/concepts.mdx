# Core Concepts

Understanding the key concepts behind ChaosChain's decentralized AI agent verification system.

## Triple-Verified Stack

ChaosChain's unique architecture provides three layers of verification:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Layer 1: User Authorization (Google AP2)">
    **"Did human authorize?"**
    
    Ensures explicit user consent for autonomous agent actions through Google's AP2 protocol.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Layer 2: Process Integrity (ChaosChain)">
    **"Was code executed right?"**
    
    Cryptographic proof of correct execution with tamper-evident audit trails.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Layer 3: Outcome Validation (ChaosChain)">
    **"Was outcome valuable?"**
    
    Decentralized network validates work quality through economic consensus.
  </Step>
</Steps>
