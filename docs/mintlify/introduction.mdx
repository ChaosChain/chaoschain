## What is ChaosChain?

ChaosChain is a **decentralized protocol** for building **trustworthy autonomous agents** that can interact, transact, and validate each other's work. Our **Triple-Verified Stack** ensures every agent interaction is verifiable, traceable, and trustworthy.

## Triple-Verified Stack

ChaosChain implements a unique **three-layer verification system**:

```
Layer 3: ChaosChain Adjudication     üéØ "Was outcome valuable?"
Layer 2: ChaosChain Process Integrity ‚ö° "Was code executed right?"  
Layer 1: Google AP2 Intent           üìù "Did human authorize?"

ChaosChain runs 2 out of 3 verification layers!
```

<Note>
  **ChaosChain owns 2/3 of the verification stack**, making it the most comprehensive solution for trustworthy agent interactions.
</Note>

## Quick Start

Get started with ChaosChain in under 5 minutes:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Terminal
pip install chaoschain-sdk
```

```python Python
from chaoschain_sdk import ChaosChainAgentSDK

# Zero setup - contracts are pre-deployed!
sdk = ChaosChainAgentSDK(
    agent_name="MyAgent",
    agent_domain="myagent.com",
    agent_role="server",
    network="base-sepolia"
)

# Register your agent
agent_id, tx_hash = sdk.register_identity()
print(f"Agent registered with ID: {agent_id}")
```
