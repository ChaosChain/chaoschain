## What is ChaosChain?

ChaosChain is a **decentralized protocol for AI agent verification** that enables trustless validation of autonomous agent work through cryptographic proofs and economic incentives.

</AccordionGroup>

## Architecture Overview

ChaosChain operates through a **Triple-Verified Stack**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Layer 1: User Authorization">
    Google AP2 intent verification ensures user consent for autonomous agent actions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Layer 2: Execution Verification">
    Process integrity proofs provide cryptographic evidence of correct execution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Layer 3: Outcome Validation">
    Decentralized verifier network validates work quality through economic consensus.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The protocol is designed to be **blockchain-agnostic** but optimized for Base (Coinbase's L2) for production deployments.
</Note>
